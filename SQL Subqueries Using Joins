Find the average amount paid by Top 5 Customers:

SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS average
  FROM 
    (SELECT B.customer_id, B.first_name,
      B.last_name,
      D.city,
      E.country,
      SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
  FROM payment A
  INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
  INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
  INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
  INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
  WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Dhule(Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Celaya', 'Nezahualcyotl','Atlixco')
  GROUP BY B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country 
  ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
  LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid_top_5_customers
  
  

Find how many of the Top 5 Customers are in each country:
  
SELECT D.country,
      COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
      COUNT(DISTINCT total_amount_paid_top_5_customers) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id 
JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id 
LEFT JOIN (SELECT B.customer_id,
      B.first_name,
      B.last_name,
      D.city,
      E.country,
      SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
   FROM payment A
   INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
   INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
   INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
   INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
   WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Dhule(Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki',
            'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Celaya', 'Nezahualcyotl','Atlixco') 
   GROUP BY B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
   LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid_top_5_customers ON D.country = total_amount_paid_top_5_customers.country
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY top_customer_count DESC
