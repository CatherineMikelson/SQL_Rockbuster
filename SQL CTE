Find the average amount paid by the Top 5 Customers:

WITH top_5_customers (customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, country, total_amount_paid) AS
    (SELECT B.customer_id,
      B.first_name,
      B.last_name,

    WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Dhule(Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki', 'Xintai', 'Adoni','Celaya', 'Nezahualcyotl','Atlixco')
    GROUP BY B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country 
    ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
    LIMIT 5)
SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS average_paid_by_top_5_customers 
FROM top_5_customers
